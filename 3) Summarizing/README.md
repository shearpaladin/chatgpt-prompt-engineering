# Summarizing

In this lesson we learn about Summarizing text with ChatGpt

- Summarize Articles/Videos to Save Time

- Summarize a book, product review, performance review...

- Summaries can give feedback and focus on certain details: "to give feedback to the Shipping Department/Pricing Department",
"focus on any aspects relevant to price/percieved value"

- You can also "extract" information from anything like a book to an article: "extract relevant information from \ 
a product review"

- If you have websites with 100s of reviews, you can browse all the reviews and grab all the main ideas your customers want. 

- This would be very good for surveys and polls to gather and predict the next trend and customer approach.
